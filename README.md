# Budget_Redistribution
Problem statement
As a part of the an Ad:tech product ecosystem, we need to create an algorithm to better redistribute the budget from the sample data set to derive more actions.

In the current attached data set, the actions are defined by “link clicks” and the objective for you is to find out the best distribution algorithm 
that can help our advertiser get more actions from the budget.
Couple of pointers you might find important/relevant: • The campaign currently is running on a total daily budget of 500. 
There is a current daily budget set at each adset • You have the last 7 days data to understand the spends (against budget allocated), 
the frequency at which the ad is shown to the user and number of actions (link clicks) we have been getting
